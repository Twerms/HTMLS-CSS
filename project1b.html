        <p id="green">If you clicked the "yes" button first, you played it safe. If I had to guess, you are probably a creature of habit, are reasonably successful, 
            liked by many, make good decisions, have a comfortable life, never take risks, stuck inside your comfort zone, basic, crave validation, self-conscious, have no interesting memories, 
            and are driven by no real purpose. <br><span class="guess">But that's just my guess.</span></p>
